Time for the next blog post and, well, I'm running late.  Been working fulltime selling cars while trying to stay focused on learning code development.  At this point I am 91% of the way through Object Oriented Ruby and currently trying to figure out how to write the CLI for the MusicImporter project. This is surprisingly difficult.  I find that I have no idea how to start this part of the code and feel like I should know.  I looked back at the CLI we wrote for the Tic-Tac-Toe project and it was a good review but no help in how to pass the first test.  I guess I need to read the lab again.  I am finding that truly understanding what each method is supposed to return and/or "do" has been crucial.  Maybe that is what I need this time. Perhaps I need to Ask a Question.  It feels like I am on the Ask Question ALL the time.  The community has been great and very helpful.  But at some point it feels like I should know this and asking a question is an admission of defeat.  I know that is not true but it just *feels* that way.     

So what have I been "writing"?  The code to pass the lab specs!  I have not really written anything of my own inspiration yet.  Don't have time.
