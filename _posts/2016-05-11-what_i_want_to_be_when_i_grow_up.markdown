## Or How do you reinvent yourself at this point?

So I am probably not the typical student at Flatiron school.  Lots of assumption in that statement.  Guessing that most students are in there 20's or 30's and are working on starting a career.  I am 51 and I have had a lot of experience in sales and leading businesses.  I have traveled the world and seen things many people only dream of seeing.  I have stood at the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa.  Looked down the slopes of Pointe du Hoc in Normandy.  I have dived the Grand Cayman reef and drank great wine in the Sonoma valley.  I have seen my two daughters grow up and now I have witnessed the birth of my first grandson.  

I have learned many lessons about life, family, and people.  One of these lessons is this:  If you do not love, or at least like, what you do you will be miserable.  Despite the money you make or status you attain.  This is a hard lesson to learn and I hope that if you are reading this at the start of your life you take heed.  Had I done so I may not have traveled to all those places but I would have had a better quality of life with those I love the most.  So that brings me to the question at hand:  How do you reinvent yourself at this point?  I am going to do what I like to do and see if it turns into a passion.

Back in the late 80's and early nineties I spent some time at Old Dominion University and Christopher Newport College.  I study engineering, computer science, and business.  In computer science I learned Fortran, COBOL, UNIX and a few other languages.  I loved the challenge and the creative process in learning how to build a useful program.  This was a time that I felt most challenged yet satisfied.  I want to recapture that feeling hence my enrollment in FlatIron. 

Currently I am finishing up the Procedural Ruby section of the curriculum.  The work has been engaging, challenging and fun.  Looking forward to the coming weeks as we dive deeper into the stack!
